In this lab you will investigate the running time of two separate algorithms
which solve the same problem: Dynamic Connectivity.

##Dynamic Connectivity

The dynamic connectivity problem begins with a set of _n_ nodes all initially
unconnected. Those nodes can be joined by a connection so that we can pass from
one node to another if there is a connection between them. Given a system of
nodes--some connected and others not--we want to know if any two are connected
either by a direct connection, or by following a path of other nodes which are
directly connected.

##Solution

There are two options for solving this problem
